# Hi there 👋 I'm Christian

Welcome to My GitHub! 🚀  

Hey there! I'm **Christian Mora**, a software developer and data enthusiast who loves coding, solving problems, and breaking (then fixing) things. If you're into web development, databases, or just some good ol' tech chaos, you've come to the right place!

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  

I work with a variety of technologies in both frontend and backend development. Here are some of my favorite tools and frameworks:  

### **Frontend:**  
- 🚀 **React.js** (Because vanilla JavaScript was too mainstream)  
- 🎨 **Next.js** (For when React needs a little extra magic)  
- 💨 **Tailwind CSS** (CSS but make it stylish and easy)  
- 🅱 **Bootstrap** (Old but gold for quick layouts)  
- ⚛️ **Redux** (Because managing state is like herding cats)  

### **Backend:**  
- 🐘 **PostgreSQL** (Because SQL is still cool!)  
- 🏗 **Laravel** (PHP but make it elegant)  
- ☕ **Spring Boot** (Java backend with some serious caffeine)  
- 🛠 **Node.js + Express** (For when you want JavaScript on both sides)
